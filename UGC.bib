8 The UGC video was actually submitted directly to GuardianWitness, the UGC initiative from
the Guardian. The video was so dramatic that it was syndicated to a number of different news
organizations, including the BBC. It is also worth noting that the video was not described as UGC
or credited.\\

pictures posted to social networks.\\

24 There is also a significant problem caused by the lack of legal precedent. One of the most confusing

useful roundup of the debate. www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2014/03/twitter_journalism_private_lives_public_speech_how_reporters_can_ethically.html.\\
